      Best Time to Visit Washington DC – Discover the Ideal Season for Your Trip
    </h2>
    <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Washington DC offers a year-round dining experience, but the best time to visit depends on your preferences. Fall is an excellent time for food lovers, with a number of food festivals like The D.C. Food and Wine Festival taking place. The crisp fall air also creates the perfect ambiance for rooftop dining.
    </p>
    <p className="text-gray-700">
      If you’re a fan of outdoor dining, summer is ideal for rooftop bars and outdoor cafes, but be prepared for the city’s high humidity. Alternatively, spring is the best time to visit for cherry blossoms and a variety of seasonal menu items that celebrate the freshness of the season’s harvest.
