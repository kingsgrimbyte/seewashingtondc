      Getting Around Washington DC – Convenient Transportation Options
    </h2>
    <p className="text-gray-700">
      Getting around Washington DC is simple, whether you’re dining in Georgetown, visiting a bar in Dupont Circle, or heading to a food festival in Adams Morgan. The Washington Metro and the DC Circulator provide easy access to DC’s top neighborhoods, and taxi services or ride-sharing apps like Uber and Lyft are great for getting to those must-try restaurants.
